If you look at ls -al /etc/resolv.conf it should resolve as a link to ../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf

The real resolv.conf should be in that directory, as well.

You can redirect the symbolic link:

sudo rm -f /etc/resolv.conf
sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

------------------------- FINAL

Step 1: Add Nameserver in /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf

nameserver 172.19.1.1

Step 2: Remove existing resolve.conf and create a new sym-link

sudo rm -f /etc/resolv.conf
sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
