Determine whether to create a file system on the disk. New disks are raw block devices, 
and you must create a file system on them before you can mount and use them. Disks that 
have been restored from snapshots likely have a file system on them already. If you create a 
new file system on top of an existing file system, the operation overwrites your data. Use the 
following command to list special information, such as file system type.


sudo file -s /dev/xvdf

You should see the following output on a brand new disk.

/dev/xvdf: data

If you see output like the following, it means that your disk already has a file system.

/dev/xvda1: Linux rev 1.0 ext4 filesystem data, UUID=1701d228-e1bd-4094-a14c-12345EXAMPLE (needs journal recovery) (extents) (large files) (huge files)

Use the following command to create an ext4 file system on the disk. Substitute the device name (such as /dev/xvdf) for device_name. Depending on the requirements of your application or the limitations of your operating system, you can choose a different file system type, such as ext3 or XFS.

sudo mkfs -t ext4 device_name # sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf

You should see output like the following.

Use the following command to create a mount point directory for the disk. The mount point is where the disk is located in the file system tree and where you read files from and write files to after you mount the disk. Substitute a location for mount_point, such as /data.

sudo mkdir /data
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data/
sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.orig
sudo nano /etc/fstab
>> Add the following line to fstab
/dev/xvdf/data    ext4   defaults,nofail0 2
